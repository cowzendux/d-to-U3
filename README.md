# d-to-U3

Excel spreadsheet to convert a d statistic to Cohen's U3

U3 can be interpreted as the percent of those in the experimental group that exceed the average person in the control
group. This statistic is often used to provide an more real-life interpretation for a statistic. Below is an example of such an interpretation.

*The mean d for assimilation is 0.3541, which, according to Cohen (1992), is a small to medium effect. With an effect of this size, we would expect that the mean value of the primed group would be equal to the 63rd percentile of the unprimed group (U3, from Cohen, 1977).*
